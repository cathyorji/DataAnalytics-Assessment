# DataAnalytics-Assessment
## Overview

This readme outlines my approach to solving the data analyst assessment questions, the challenges I encountered, and the solutions I implemented. The assessment involved using SQL to analyze customer data and calculate key metrics.
For each question, I conducted a thorough analysis to determine the specific data requirements, necessary calculations, and the expected outputs. I developed SQL queries to extract, transform, and aggregate data from the relevant tables. Throughout the process, I accounted for potential edge cases, such as customers with no transactions or accounts that were created but not yet used, and implemented logic to handle them appropriately. My focus was on writing efficient, well-structured, and readable SQL queries by applying suitable joins, filters, and aggregation methods. I carefully tested each query to ensure accuracy and that all specified requirements were fully met.
